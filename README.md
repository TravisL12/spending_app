### Spending Application

A few years ago I started keeping a very precise log of my spending in a spreadsheet. This was all seeded by downloading my online banking data and making various plots, and predictions on how my spending was going.

This fascination in spending has lead to me tracking other metrics of my personal life mainly out of curiosity. This personal tracking was primarily a reason why I wanted to learn Ruby on Rails. So I could build personal tracking apps for anyone to use.
